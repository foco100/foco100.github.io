    <p class="links"> <a href="https://tuas.ucsd.edu">TUAS</a> is a collegiate student organization that participates in the <a href="https://www.auvsi-suas.org/">AUVSI SUAS</a> international competition that asks teams to build an autonomous plane. The team mainly splits into four subteams, Airframe, Embedded, Software, and Business, to tackle the tasks necessary to participate in this competition.  I have been one of the <a href="https://tuas.ucsd.edu/embedded.html">embedded subteam</a> leads at TUAS for the past two years, which is the subteam responsible for all the developing and configuration electronic connections that the project requires.</p>

    <h2>Power Distribution Board</h2>
    <p class="link">During my third year at project, I began working on the power distribution board that serves as a supply for the various peripheral devices that the plane requires to fly autonomously. This project was an overhual from a previous iteration that had some complications due to deprecated components. Fortunately, I was able to develop a proof of concept that will soon power our peripheral devices. However, we are now working on reimplementing this board with surface mount devices, which will expediate the manufacturing process.</p>

    <h2>Unmanned Ground Vehicle</h2>
    <p class="link">Currently, along with other embedded members, we are assisting the airframe team to develop our unmanned ground vehicle. This vehicle is aimed to be autonomous as well, so we have been focused on implementing a controller for autonomous landing, as the drving controller is fairly trivial. This controller will steer a parachute to land as close as possible to a desired position.</p>

    <h2>Antenna Tracker</h2>
    <p class="link">When I joined TUAS, I started working on the antenna tracker. This project was not very fruitful at the beginning, as there were some compatibility issues for the way that we inteded to integrate the antenna tracker to the rest of our ground control station set up. Thus, we decided to develop our own firmware for the antenna tracker for more versatility and ease of setup while at a remote location.</p>
