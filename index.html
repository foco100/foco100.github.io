    <h2> Objective: </h2>
        I aim to obtain a thorough education about circuits and the fields that closely surround it, where I learn and consistently put into practice this knowledge for my development in this field.
    <h2> Education: </h2>
        UC, San Diego: Sep ‘17 - Present; fourth year Electrical Engineering undergraduate candidate with emphasis in circuits and systems.
    <h2> Work related experience: </h2>
        <b>UCSD ATS:</b> Oct ‘17 - Jan ‘18
<br>
        <i>IT Desk Help</i><!--; my responsibilities at the help desk included to assist faculty staff directly by responding to tickets as instructed by my superiors, and I assisted my superiors in completing some of their duties. These duties ranged from setting up and maintaining electronic equipment, such as desktop computers, printers, peripherals, amongst others, and making sure that these devices had access to the university’s server.-->
