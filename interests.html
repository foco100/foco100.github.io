    <h1>Interests</h1> 

    <h2>Professional Interests</h2>
    <img src="src/interests/165project.png" class="pic">
    <h3>Digital Design</h3>
    <p class="link">I have some experience doing digital circuits layout, and I interested on learning more about doing digital layout through algorithms such as Verilog. I believe field programmable gate arrays offer great flexibility that can provide the best solution for many projects, nowadays. Therefore, I aim to work on more FPGAs in the near future.</p>

    <h3>Analog Circuits</h3>
    <p class="link">I am fairly interested in working on projects pertaining analog circuit design as they effort a certain level of depth that attracts me. Specifically, I would want to work on a communications related project, as this is topic of great significance for everyone and the applications have a broad range.</p>

    <h3>Power Electronics</h3>
    <p class="link">Additionally, I am intrigued to work on some smaller power electronics projects, which could often relate to what I expect to do in a communications project. I understand that biasing and supplying the appropriate is very important for optimally performing circuits, hence I believe I can use my current experience of power electronics to learn more about how to produce the best circuits.</p>

    <h3>Control Systems</h3>
    <p class="link">Fortunately, my exposure to control systems has ranged across various fields, from power electronics to even mechanical systems. I would like to learn more about control systems, as this knowledge is quintessetial for integrated circuit design. Additionally, I am intrigued on applications of control systems in fields other than electrical engineering, as these can illustrate different approaches to controls problems.</p>
