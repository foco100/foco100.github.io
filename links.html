    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p> I decided to present these three specific "resume" themed website as they show different approaches to present one as a professional involved in projects. It is clear that each author has a different focus on how they present themselves due to what stage of their career they find themselves. At the same time, cater towards a specific format to give a particular message. In addition, I use some website as design inspiration for this website, as colors can be hard implement and overall navigation also necessitates prior experience, given that I hard coded this website.</p>

    <h2><a href="https://garrettgibo.github.io/"> Garrett Gibo </a></h2>
    <p> Garrett Gibo is one of my peers, so we are at a similar stage career-wise, i.e. we are both at the end of undergraduate education. However, Garrett is a data science major, which places him in a different working field with different interests. At the same time, as he is working in a different field there are different conventions for what employers look for in a candidate. Thus, most of his projects portfolio lies in <a href="https://github.com/garrettgibo">GitHub</a>. But, I still find his simplistic approach inspiring while also acknowledging the importance of highlighting contact information. </p>

    <h2><a href="http://eliasson.mines.edu/cv.html"> Prof. Veronica Eliasson </a></h2>
    <p> While Prof. Eliasson is also does not work in the same field as what I want to work on, I recently was looking at her website and I was intrigued on her approach for presenting her experience. I subscribe to having CV-like principal page like her, but I align more on the preference of being concise in this page and then elaborate on the major projects in other pages. However, I believe that the counter and the numerous amount of lines in this page does strike me that Prof. Eliasson is an individual involved in many things. Namely, the many things listed help her state that she is constantly involved in a meaningful project. Lastly, the elavator feature at the end of her page is a nice touch that whimsically cements this point, as it tours you back to the top showing all her projects again.</p>

    <h2><a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/"> Michael Stapelberg </a></h2>
    <p> While Garrett's and Prof. Eliason's webiste give me a good sense of what features and what structure I would use on my webiste, Michael Stapelberg's website gave me a better sense of how to integrate projects ina more "fleshed out" manner. While I am not going as in depth as Stapelberg's blog posts, I still follow a similar format in the sense that I document projects with a mixture of text and images to make my website an engaging experience.</p>

    <h2><a href="https://novelkeys.xyz"> NovelKeys </a></h2>
    <p> I decided to use a similar color scheme as NovelKeys' webiste. I like the matte and muted color schemethat the website uses because it is easy on the eyes and allows for the images to stand out. However, I opted to use the Thinkpad color palette with the same overall theme, as I am a fan of these laptop, which I aimed would make my website more personal.</p>

    <h2><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_topnav.as://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_topnav.asp"> w3shools </a></h2>
    <p> Given that I do not have much experience designing a website, I consulted w3school for some navigation methods. I was very compelled with using a topbar, since this consicely layouts the major topics that website covers, while also not being obtrusive. Nevtherless, I made some modifications to the topbar to make it more interative, such as enlarging the active tab besides coloring with a highlighting hue.</p>

    <h2><a href="http://www.kroah.com/log/about.html">How to submit kernel changes</a></h2>
    <p> Towards the end of setttin up this website, I was unsatisfied with my "Contact" page, as I only had my email. So, I consulted some other people's websites who have had their website online for a couple of years. I find it useful how Greg Kroah-Hartman has a link to instructions for how to contact him to submit any kernel changes to Linux. Thus, I believe some preface with a similar spiritual inspiration would be helpful just to make the Contact page more formal and engaging. </p>
